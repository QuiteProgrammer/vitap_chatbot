# VITAP Chatbot Mini Project

## Project Description
This is a simple chatbot for VITAP (VIT Amaravati) college, built as a mini project for the course. The chatbot provides information on FAQs about VITAP, courses available, course registration, hostel registration, venues, classes, faculty info (including faculty cabins and department venues), upcoming events, and guidance for backlog students on re-registering for courses.

## Features
- Keyword-based response matching
- Covers all specified categories
- Web-based interface using Streamlit
- Easy to deploy and run

## Innovation and Functionality of the System
- **Innovation**: Uses simple AI technique of keyword matching to simulate intelligent responses without complex NLP.
- **Functionality**: Responds accurately to user queries based on predefined keywords. Handles general queries with a default response.

## Implementation of AI Techniques
- **AI Technique Used**: Keyword matching (a basic form of pattern recognition).
- **How it works**: The chatbot scans user input for specific keywords and maps them to predefined responses stored in a dictionary.

## Presentation and Documentation
- **Presentation**: The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access. Code is well-commented and structured.
- **Documentation**: This README provides setup, usage, and evaluation details. Code includes comments for clarity.

## Individual Understanding and Contribution
- **Understanding**: I have implemented the chatbot from scratch, understanding the basics of AI in chatbots, web deployment, and Python programming.
- **Contribution**: Sole developer of the project, responsible for design, coding, testing, and deployment.
